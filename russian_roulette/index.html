    <h3>Whats Russian Roullette (Русская рулетка)</h3>
    <p>Russian roulette is a game of chance that has become infamous for its deadly consequences. The game involves
      loading a single bullet into a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then pulling the trigger while pointing the
      gun at one's own head. The player takes their chances with fate, risking their life on the hope that the bullet
      will not be in the chamber when the trigger is pulled.</p>
    </br>
    <p>The origins of Russian roulette are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Russia during the late 19th
      century. The game was often played by soldiers as a way to pass the time and relieve the boredom of war. It soon
      became popular among the civilian population as well, and it was often played in bars and other social settings.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>The danger and thrill of the game have made it a subject of fascination in popular culture. It has been depicted
      in films, books, and music, and has been used as a metaphor for risk-taking and recklessness. Some have even
      claimed that the game is a metaphor for the human condition, with life itself being a game of chance in which we
      take risks and make choices that can have deadly consequences.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Despite its popularity, Russian roulette is an extremely dangerous game that has claimed many lives over the
      years. The risk of death or serious injury is very real, and those who play the game are taking a reckless and
      unnecessary risk with their lives. In the end, the allure of the game is outweighed by the tragic consequences
      that often result from playing it.</p>
