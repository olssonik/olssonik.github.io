        I am a self-taught web developer who has learned through my own
        dedication and practice. I have explored different web development
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm quite good at them.
        By working on personal projects and constantly improving myself, I have
        developed a solid foundation in creating attractive and user-friendly
        websites. I have also focused on learning about Linux, which is an
        operating system like Windows or macOS but a bit different. I have
        gained a lot of knowledge about different versions of Linux, how to use
        the command line, and how to write scripts. This expertise allows me to
        effectively manage computer systems, install software, and configure
        networks for web development. My main goal is to specialize in
        cybersecurity, which means protecting computer systems and data from
        online threats. I understand the importance of keeping digital
        information secure, and I am eager to learn more about cybersecurity
        practices. This includes identifying and preventing threats, assessing
        vulnerabilities, and responding to security incidents. I want to become
        a cybersecurity professional who can defend against evolving threats and
        make digital systems safer.
